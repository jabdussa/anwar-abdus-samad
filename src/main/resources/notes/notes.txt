Remember that if the schema already exists flyway will complain. 

You may need to recreate the schema with no tables.

Once the schema has been recreated issue the sbt flywayMigrate command to recreate your tables.


shell> mysql -u <user> -p <password> --execute="CREATE <schema>"

shell> sbt flywayMigrate
